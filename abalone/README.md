# Abalone

Abalone is a board game that i used to play as a child. I think its not as overanalyzed as chess so
could be a good game to write an AI. Also i like this game as i have played it before so i am
looking forward to play against my own AI or even create an AI that plays better than me (is that
possible?).

I could find two useful references about other people making something like this. So maybe i can
play my AI against theirs. But i dont want to just reuse their code as this is a learning  activity.
So i will check my solution afterwards against what they have done.
