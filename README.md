# Machine Learning
Testing different kind of machine learning algorithms and packages, analysis.

# Timeseries

[notebook](https://github.com/jano31415/machine_learning/tree/main/covid) covid cases analysis using facebook prophet package for Timeseries.

# Computer vision
### MNIST digit classifier:
[notebook](https://github.com/jano31415/machine_learning/blob/main/mnist/mnist.ipynb):

Train digit classifier and test it on self written digits.

Test trained convolutional neural network on stability to translation.

Using shap package to explain the model (Explainable AI)

### Fashion Mnist unsupervised pre training
[notebook](https://github.com/jano31415/machine_learning/blob/main/fashion_mnist/embeddings.ipynb):

Dimensionality reduction techniques:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- T-SNE
- Autoencoder

Transfer Learning vs unsupervised pre training on small subset of training data:
- Transfer Learning from imagenet Deep Learning network EfficientNetB0
- Encode training all training data with Autoencoder, train encoded data points
